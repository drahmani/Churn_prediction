# Telco Customet Churn prediction
Churn (attrition) in the context of a subscriber-based service model is the measure of the
number of individuals that leave the supplier during a given time period. Churn rate is a
possible indicator of customer dissatisfaction, cheaper and/or better offers from the
competition, more successful sales and/or marketing by the competition, or reasons having
to do with the customer life cycle.
Predicting churn is a very important factor for service providers that allows for taking
various actions that prevent churn and avoid revenue loss.
